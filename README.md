**BERT-based Sentiment Classification on IMDB Dataset**
This repository contains code for building, training, and evaluating a BERT-based sentiment classification model. The workflow includes pretraining a BERT model for masked language modeling and then fine-tuning it for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset.

Data Loading
This project uses the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to prepare for both masked language modeling and sentiment classification.

Dataset Preparation
The data is split into training, validation, and test sets. Tokenization is performed using the BERT tokenizer to prepare the data for input into the BERT model.

Model Training
Pretraining (Masked Language Modeling): The BERT model is first pretrained on the IMDB dataset for masked language modeling. This step helps the model better understand the language context of the dataset.

Model Saving: After pretraining, the model is saved for use in downstream tasks.

Fine-Tuning
The pretrained BERT model is fine-tuned specifically for sentiment classification on the IMDB dataset. Fine-tuning adjusts the model to distinguish between positive and negative sentiment.

End-to-End Model Evaluation
The end-to-end model is evaluated on a held-out test set. Metrics such as accuracy calculated to measure performance on sentiment classification.
